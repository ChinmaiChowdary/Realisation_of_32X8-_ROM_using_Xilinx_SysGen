# Realisation_of_32X8-_ROM_using_Xilinx_SysGen
Xilinx System Generator for DSP (SysGen) is a MATLAB Simulink add-on that enables the development of architecture-level FPGA designs using graphical blocks programming.Simulink allows users to simulate their ideas, which may then be packaged as a Vivado IP and quickly imported into a Vivado project.
